            <p class="section__content">
                In their journey across the cosmos, Alex and Zorg stumbled upon a place unlike any they had ever seen—a bustling marketplace that floated amidst the stars like a celestial carnival, its neon-lit corridors alive with the hustle and bustle of traders and travelers from every corner of the galaxy.
